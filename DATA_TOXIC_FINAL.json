The other one really hurt at the time (I got over it almost immediately) but he told me off for picking up my beer near the rim rather than at the base. Gay. I think it hurt because I was enjoying a dad-bonding moment at the time which was a moment for me at 18. There was another time much later.when I mentioned that the grandson of an elderly friend of ours was a ridiculously good looking guy. Sure it sounds gay but it really wasn\u2019t. The downside was that although he didn\u2019t say anything at the time, he chose to bring it up when this guy was present a few months later. I\u2019m totally not gay.
