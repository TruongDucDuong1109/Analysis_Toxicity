That\u2019s super cool.\nFull Abstract\nTo better understand how network structure shapes intelligent behavior, we developed a learning algorithm that we used to build personalized brain network models for 650 Human Connectome Project participants. We found that participants with higher intelligence scores took more time to solve difficult problems, and that slower solvers had higher average functional connectivity. With simulations we identified a mechanistic link between functional connectivity, intelligence, processing speed and brain synchrony for trading accuracy with speed in dependence of excitation-inhibition balance. Reduced synchrony led decision-making circuits to quickly jump to conclusions, while higher synchrony allowed for better integration of evidence and more robust working memory. Strict tests were applied to ensure reproducibility and generality of the obtained results. Here, we identify links between brain structure and function that enable to learn connectome topology from noninvasive recordings and map it to inter-individual differences in behavior, suggesting broad utility for research and clinical applications.",

In the research, Professor Petra Ritter and her team effectively created \"brain avatars\" that replicated the decision-making patterns and intellectual performance of their biological counterparts1.\nA key take-away from this study is that higher synchronization, or the formation of functional networks in the brain, affects the properties of working memory and thus the ability to endure prolonged periods without a decision. This gathering of evidence for a particular solution may sometimes take longer, but it leads to better results1.\nThis understanding of the role of synchronization in decision-making and problem-solving could have implications for the development of AI. By mimicking the \"slow thinking\" approach of intelligent human brains, we could potentially develop AI systems that are better at problem-solving and decision-making, even if they take a bit longer to arrive at a decision. Such AI systems would be particularly beneficial in complex, real-world situations where the cost of an incorrect decision could be high.\nFurthermore, the study's findings could influence how we interpret the speed of decision-making in AI systems. Rather than equating speed with intelligence, we might need to consider the complexity of the problem at hand and the potential for errors in quick decision-making.\nFinally, one of the most exciting aspects of this research is its potential applications in personalized medicine. The computer-based brain avatars used in the study could be used in the future for personalized in silico planning of surgical and drug interventions as well as therapeutic brain stimulation.\nI hope this brings a new perspective to the discussion!\nGPT",

Any problem over a certain complexity threshold is given the \"best guess\" treatment. Since IQ correlates negatively with impulsivity, it makes sense that they just make their best guess rather than sitting and thinking about it for a bit. It makes me wonder if IQ is dependent on impulsivity, e.g. they aren't patient enough to let their slower thought processes play out, regardless of if they have the ability to do so.\nThe problem here is that this study may just be measuring impulsivity and not intelligence. Were they incentivized to perform well with a reward? If not, there may be a bias there. People who are patient will take more time and this will yield a better result.

I'm very analytical and I'd like to think I have an above average IQ(at least that's what the test scores have said). I'm also good with my hands. My brother is a smart guy but doesn't think before doing things. He starts and just shoots off without planning. His argument was that he can install a tap before I could finish planning and preparing. I told him that may be true sometimes, but over enough attempts planning will win out. We fought like siblings should with a healthy dose of insults thrown in. I do see how some people suffer from analysis paralysis (it is happening to me right now because I have to decided between 2 jobs, the one pays more but the other seems more enjoyable) but I do think a little planning and thought before you set off or during goes a long way to ensure your choice has a bigger chance of being correct. I also went for an aptitude test during an interview and they clearly said to be accurate over completing. So I didn't rush, made sure to work everything out(I asked for a pen and paper even). They offered me the job but I turned it down because I didn't want to work for people that do aptitude tests. I preferred accuracy over precision.

Specify everything you can. Draw a diagram. Etc.

Most of problems specifically initiate those shortcuts but have a more hidden extra layer that you won't see if you don't layout the problem entirely.\nI'd be very interested in the accuracy of the solutions from the \"less intelligent\" group.",

The math questions on all the practice exams were pretty easy for me. Based on the number of questions, I knew I had like 5 minutes per question. So, in all my practice exams, I paced myself at 4 minutes each, which would let me check my work as I went, rather than revisiting questions at the end. However, unlike the practice exams, the actual test was on a computer and it had dynamic difficulty balancing. So, the more questions I got right, the harder the questions got. I ended up needing way more time for the later questions and I think I only got to answer like 20/25 questions before I ran out of time. I ended up scoring higher on the verbal reasoning section, which is crazy because I\u2019ve always been better at math.",

        "comment": "They take a lot more into account and don't believe everything is simple. Someone with low IQ would do the bare minimum. Empathy, an open mind, and critical thinking are applied to everything when you have a higher IQ. IQ also determines your ability to learn something new and use it. For example, someone with high test scores doesn't give them a high IQ, it means you have a good memory. There are a lot of bad doctors who got great test scores but get terrible reviews on Yelp. They don't have critical thinking skills (the ability to use what you've memorized). Think inventors with autism and ADHD\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlow test scores, some don't even graduate, but they're naturally born engineers able to see and understand the world.\nPeople who say others overthink often have a lower IQ. They attempt to simplify everything and ignore variables. Take our legal system that deems children from abusive homes as criminals because of 'the life they choose' when they don't get to choose what they learn. Kids don't know what you don't teach them. If the good doesn't outweigh the bad, they will become 'mentally ill/traumatized,' which is a natural reaction to danger. Evolution does that to people. Their brain then will only focus on the bad, paint the world a dangerous place where you must fight to stay alive. If you're lucky, depression is all that will come of it. Others commit suicide, end up homeless, self-medicating with hard drugs, or turn to criminal activity and violence they learned throughout life. And all that gets ignored by society heavily because it's simpler for people to label all that as a criminal and pack them in prisons and never think about them again.\nThen you have to take into account whether they're HSP (highly sensitive persons), meaning their nervous system takes more damage per trauma event than the common person or not. Two different people in the exact same traumatizing situations: one could become a billionaire, and the other may choose suicide, with a spectrum of possibility in between.\nThe fact that mental health is genetic\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso are fears, memories, and thoughts you have. They can and will be passed to your kids. What do you do when you're third or fourth-generation PTSD and have fears embedded in your DNA that most therapists don't even realize is a thing? That's PTSD that's been stacking for decades in the bloodline. (Google 'Mouse and the Cherry Blossom' study).",
